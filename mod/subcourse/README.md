Subcourse module for Moodle
===========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mudrd8mz/moodle-mod_subcourse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mudrd8mz/moodle-mod_subcourse)

This Moodle module provides very simple yet useful functionality. When added into a course, it behaves as a graded activity. The
grade for each student is took from a final grade in another course. Combined with
[metacourses](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_meta_link), this allows course designers to organize courses into separate units.
