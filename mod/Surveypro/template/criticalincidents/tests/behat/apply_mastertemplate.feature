  In order to verify mastertemplates apply correctly // Why this feature is useful
  As a teacher                                       // It can be 'an admin', 'a teacher', 'a student', 'a guest', 'a user', 'a tests writer' and 'a developer'
  I need to apply a mastertemplate                   // The feature we want
